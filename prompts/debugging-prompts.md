## üéØ Best Debugging Practices

### Information to Always Include

1. **Exact error messages** (copy-paste, don't paraphrase)
2. **Steps to reproduce** (be specific)
3. **Environment details** (browser, device, OS)
4. **Recent changes** (what was modified recently)
5. **Console output** (full logs, not just summaries)

### Debugging Workflow

1. **Identify** the exact problem
2. **Isolate** the component/function causing it
3. **Check logs** (console, network, server logs)
4. **Reproduce** consistently
5. **Test fixes** incrementally
6. **Document** the solution in .nbc.md

### When to Use Emergency Reset

If debugging becomes overwhelming:

```
NUCLEAR RESET: Too many issues, let's start fresh and rebuild this feature properly.
```

## üìù Logging Issues

Remember to log solved issues in `.nbc.md`:

```
## [DATE] - [ISSUE_TYPE]: [Brief Description]
**Problem:** [What was wrong]
**Solution:** [How it was fixed]
**Prevention:** [How to avoid in future]
```
